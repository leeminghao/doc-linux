set_bit
========================================

```
/**
 * set_bit - Atomically set a bit in memory
 * @nr: the bit to set
 * @addr: the address to start counting from
 *
 * This function is atomic and may not be reordered.  See __set_bit()
 * if you do not require the atomic guarantees.
 *
 * Note: there are no guarantees that this function will not be reordered
 * on non x86 architectures, so if you are writing portable code,
 * make sure not to rely on its reordering guarantees.
 *
 * Note that @nr may be almost arbitrarily large; this function is not
 * restricted to acting on a single-word quantity.
