__ref
========================================

path: include/linux/init.h
```
/*
 * modpost check for section mismatches during the kernel build.
 * A section mismatch happens when there are references from a
 * code or data section to an init section (both code or data).
 * The init sections are (for most archs) discarded by the kernel
 * when early init has completed so all such references are potential bugs.
 * For exit sections the same issue exists.
 *
 * The following markers are used for the cases where the reference to
 * the *init / *exit section (code or data) is valid and will teach
 * modpost not to issue a warning.  Intended semantics is that a code or
 * data tagged __ref* can reference code or data from init section without
 * producing a warning (of course, no warning does not mean code is
 * correct, so optimally document why the __ref is needed and why it's OK).
 *
 * The markers follow same syntax rules as __init / __initdata.
