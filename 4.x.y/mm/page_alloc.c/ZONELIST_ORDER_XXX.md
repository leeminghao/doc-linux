ZONELIST_ORDER_XXX
========================================

path: mm/page_alloc.c
```
*
 *  zonelist_order:
 *  0 = automatic detection of better ordering.
 *  1 = order by ([node] distance, -zonetype)
 *  2 = order by (-zonetype, [node] distance)
 *
 *  If not NUMA, ZONELIST_ORDER_ZONE and ZONELIST_ORDER_NODE will create
 *  the same zonelist. So only NUMA can configure this param.
