/*
 * A number of key systems in x86 including ioremap() rely on the assumption
 * that high_memory defines the upper bound on direct map memory, then end
 * of ZONE_NORMAL.  Under CONFIG_DISCONTIG this means that max_low_pfn and
 * highstart_pfn must be the same; there must be no gap between ZONE_NORMAL
